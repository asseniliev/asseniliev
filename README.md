# <img src="giphy.gif" width="15%"> Hello! I'm Asen.

## About my competencies
In June 2022 I started my personal project for career redirection with objective to become a professional deveoloper. As milestones of this initiative I completed the [Telerik Academy C# training program](https://www.telerikacademy.com/alpha/csharp) which lasted 6 months. It was immediately followed by [La Capsule Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.lacapsule.academy/formation-developpeur-web/full-time) training that continued for 2 and a half months and finished in mid March 2023.

My portfolio shared below consists mostly of projects (small and bigger) realized during these trainings. As such, they are generally with academic purposes.

Today, I have an inetrmediate level of C# OOP and DSA and can handle the basis of C# Web development following MVC pattern with ASP.NET and Entity Framework.

In Javascript and related MERN stack, I have junior level, able to handle frontend and backend developments with React, Next.JS and Express.

I am currently making further efforts to profound my knowledge in these domains. Also, started a free tutorial in PHP for beginners.

## A little history of mine...
I developped my first programs in Basic for Apple II 8 bit architecture still in the 80s. Since then, I did a few university projects for science in Fortan and Turbo Pascal in the beginning of the 90s. My love to programing dates back still from those times far, far away...

As professional occupancy, since 1999 I was doing SAP ABAP programmin for almost 15 years. However, this was more a secondary activity in parallel to my consultancy for SAP business deployment.

More regular exercises I started in year 2012 when I began following C# programming courses in Udemy and open source tutorials in Youtube. In 2016 I discovered Unity game engine (which also uses C# for scripts programming) that helped afirm my OOP and DSA knowledge.
