# <img src="giphy.gif" width="15%"> Hello! I'm Asen.

## About my competencies
In June 2022 I started my personal project for career redirection with objective to become a professional deveoloper. As first milestone of this initiative I completed the [Telerik Academy C# training program](https://www.telerikacademy.com/alpha/csharp) which lasted 6 months. There I built on the C# competences I previously had with more profound understanding of OOP and DSA and obtained new skills in Web programming.
As a second milestone, I immediately followed [La Capsule Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.lacapsule.academy/formation-developpeur-web/full-time) training that continued for 2 and a half months and finished in mid March 2023. There I obtained basis knowledge on the MERN stack, which was a completely new universe to me.

Today, I have an inetrmediate level of C# OOP and DSA and can handle the basis of C# Web development following MVC pattern with ASP.NET and Entity Framework.

In Javascript and related MERN stack, I have junior level, able to handle frontend and backend developments with React, Next.JS and Express.

I am currently making further efforts to profound my knowledge in these domains. Also, started a free tutorial in PHP for beginners.

My portfolio shared below consists mostly of projects (small and bigger) realized during these trainings. As such, they are generally with academic purposes.

## A little history of mine...
As a college student, I developped my first programs in Basic for Apple II 8 bit architecture still in the late 80s. Later I did a few university projects for science in Fortan and Turbo Pascal in the 90s. My love to programing dates back still from those times far away. It persisted through my career and I was always coming back to it in my professional work or in my free time. Now I wanted to switch to it permanently.

As professional occupancy, since 1999 I was doing SAP ABAP programmin for almost 15 years. However, this was more a secondary activity in parallel to my consultancy for SAP business deployment.

More regular exercises I started in year 2012 when I began following C# programming courses in Udemy and open source tutorials in Youtube. In 2016 I discovered Unity game engine (which also uses C# for scripts programming) that helped afirm my OOP and DSA knowledge.
